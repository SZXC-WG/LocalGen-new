## Intro

Welcome to the **Local Generals.io (LocalGen)** project!

With LocalGen, you can now play **[generals.io](http://generals.io)** **entirely offline**!

Enjoy the game with **ready-to-use** bots or challenge your friends over the **same LAN** network!

Interested? Get started by downloading **LocalGen** from the [releases page](http://github.com/SZXC-WG/LocalGen-new/releases).

Got a new idea or discovered a bug? We welcome contributions! Simply **open an issue or submit a pull request**, and we’ll get back to you as soon as possible.

## [Releases (Changelog)](http://github.com/SZXC-WG/LocalGen-new/releases)

We strongly recommend downloading the latest pre-release version (the top option on the overall release page) rather than the "Latest Release." The current stable release (v4.1.0) is significantly outdated, as there have been substantial code changes since v4.2.0. Many of the new features in the latest releases are not compatible with the functionalities in v4.1.0. For a more detailed overview of these changes, please refer to the changelogs.

## Weak Robots? Time to Write a New One!

Absolutely! We welcome any form of contribution. Check out the instructions at [#31](../../issues/31) for more details.

## Contributing

LocalGen’s development is organized across three groups of branches:

- **`master` | `v6.x`**:  
  The `master` branch serves as the main development branch for version 6.  
  **Starting from v6, we will be migrating the UI to the Qt library**, aiming for better performance and cross-platform support. The source code will also undergo a significant refactor to improve maintainability.
  
- **`v5.x`**:  
  This branch covers version 5, which is now going to **long-term maintenance** (formerly under active development).  
  Versions 2 to 5 of LocalGen are built with [EGE Graphics](http://xege.org), and we’re working on creating an object-oriented system based on EGE.  
  **Note:** Releases for this branch are **Windows-only** due to EGE’s limitations. However, if you want to run it on Linux or macOS, [**Wine**](https://www.winehq.org) might be an option.

- **`release`**:  
  This branch is used to store older version releases (v1-v4) and related resources like maps and fonts. For newer version releases, head over to the [releases page](http://github.com/SZXC-WG/LocalGen-new/releases).

If you'd like to contribute, please submit a pull request to the `v5.0` branch. We appreciate your help!

> [!CAUTION]  
>  
> You’re currently viewing the `master` branch, which is dedicated to v6. This version is still under active development and not yet finished.  
>  
> To download older, stable versions of the game, head to the [releases page](http://github.com/SZXC-WG/LocalGen-new/releases).  
>  
> If you want to build the project yourself, please visit one of the `v5.x` branches. Enjoy!
