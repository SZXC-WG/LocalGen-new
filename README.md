## Intro

Welcome to the project of Local Generals.io (LocalGen)!

Here you can play [generals.io](http://generals.io) **completely offline**!

Enjoy playing with **out-of-the-box** robots or your friends (same LAN)!

Interested? Download LocalGen on [the releases page](http://github.com/SZXC-WG/LocalGen-new/releases).

New idea? Old bugs? Contribute to the project! Simply **create an issue or a pull request**, and we'll reach out to you soon.

## [Releases (Changelog)](http://github.com/SZXC-WG/LocalGen-new/releases)

We strongly recommend downloading the latest pre-release version (the top option on the overall release page) rather than the "Latest Release." The current stable release (v4.1.0) is significantly outdated, as there have been substantial code changes since v4.2.0. Many of the new features in the latest releases are not compatible with the functionalities in v4.1.0. For a more detailed overview of these changes, please refer to the changelogs.

## Weak robots! Write a new one?

Certainly! We appreciate any form of contribution. See the instructions at [#31](../../issues/31).

## Contributing

LocalGen is currently split into three types of branches:

- **`master`|`v6.x`**: With `master` being the main branch, these branches contain source files for version 6.
  **Starting from v6, we will migrate our UI to the Qt library.**
  This version hopefully gives optimized performance and cross-platform support. The source code will be refactored as well.
- **`v5.x`**: The branches for version 5, which is **~~under active development~~ going to long-term maintenance**.
  LocalGen versions 2 to 5 are built with [EGE Graphics](http://xege.org).
  We are trying to build an object-oriented system based on EGE.
  The releases published under this branch are **Windows only** for the limitations of EGE.
  [**Wine**](https://www.winehq.org) may be an option if you really want to run it on Linux/macOS systems.
- **`release`**: Used for saving releases of older versions (v1-v4) and storing map/fonts. **Releases for newer versions can be found in the releases page.**

To contribute to our project, please create a pull request on the `v5.0` branch. Thanks.

> [!CAUTION]
>
> You are currently viewing the `master` branch, for v6. This new version is still in development and not ready yet.
>
> Please download older versions for the full game from the [the releases page](http://github.com/SZXC-WG/LocalGen-new/releases).
>
> If you'd like to build the project by yourself, visit a `v5.x` branch. Enjoy!
