## Intro

Welcome to the project of Local Generals.io (LocalGen)!

Here you can play [generals.io](http://generals.io) **completely offline**!

Enjoy playing with **out-of-the-box** robots or your friends (same LAN)!

Interested? Download LocalGen on [the releases page](http://github.com/SZXC-WG/LocalGen-new/releases).

New idea? Old bugs? Contribute to the project! Simply **create an issue or a pull request**, and we'll reach out to you soon.

## [Releases (Changelog)](http://github.com/SZXC-WG/LocalGen-new/releases)

We have to say that we currently recommend that you should download the latest pre-releases (the top one in the overall release page) instead of the so-called "Latest Release". The latest stable release (`v4.1.0`) is far too outdated due to the enormous amount of code changes since `v4.2.0`. Now many functions in the new releases are not compatible with functions in release `v4.1.0`. Further information can be seen from the changelogs.

## Weak robots! Write a new one?

Certainly! We appreciate any form of contribution. See the instructions at [#31](../../issues/31).

## Contributing

LocalGen is currently split into three types of branches:

- **`master`|`v6.x`**: With `master` being the main branch, these branches contain source files for version 6.
  **Starting from v6, we will migrate our UI to the Qt library.**
  This version hopefully gives optimized performance and cross-platform support. The source code will be refactored as well.
- **`v5.x`**: The branches for version 5, which is **~~under active development~~ going to long-term maintenance**.
  LocalGen versions 2 to 5 are built with [EGE Graphics](http://xege.org).
  We are trying to build an object-oriented system based on EGE.
  The releases published under this branch are **Windows only** for the limitations of EGE.
  [**Wine**](https://www.winehq.org) may be an option if you really want to run it on Linux/macOS systems.
- **`release`**: Used for saving releases of older versions (v1-v4) and storing map/fonts. **Releases for newer versions can be found in the releases page.**

To contribute to our project, please create a pull request on the `v5.0` branch. Thanks.

> [!CAUTION]
>
> You are currently viewing the `master` branch, for v6. This new version is still in development and not ready yet.
>
> Please download older versions for the full game from the [the releases page](http://github.com/SZXC-WG/LocalGen-new/releases).
>
> If you'd like to build the project by yourself, visit a `v5.x` branch. Enjoy!
