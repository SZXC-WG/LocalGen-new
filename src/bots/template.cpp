 * PLEASE READ THIS COMMENT AND THIS FILE CAREFULLY BEFORE YOU START TO
 * IMPLEMENT YOUR OWN BOT.
 *
 * This "DummyBot" is a simple example of how to create a bot.
 * Developers can refer to this file when implementing their own bots.
 * The bot implemented a pretty basic algorithm, just being an example.
 *
 * Like this file, bot codes should be put into the `src/bots` folder.
